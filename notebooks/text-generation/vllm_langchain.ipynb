    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we are going to use Python to connect and query an LLM directly through its API. For this Lab we have selected the model **Mistral-7B Instruct v2**.(https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2). This is a fully Open Source model (Apache 2.0 license), that although much lighter than other commercial or open source models is very capable, especially with the tasks we intend to use it for.\n",

    "This model has already been deployed on the Lab cluster because even if it's a smaller model, it still needs a GPU with 24GB of RAM to run..."

    "We will start by creating an **llm** instance, defined by the location where the LLM API can be queried and some parameters that will be applied to the model. For example, `max_new_tokens` will instruct the model to answer with a maximum of 512 tokens (words or parts of words). `temperature`, set really low here, will instruct the model to stay truth-grounded, and not try to be too \"creative\". After all, we're not trying to write a fancy poem here!"
